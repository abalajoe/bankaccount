A Clojure library designed to mimic a bank account deposit, withdrawal and balance actions.

## Usage

Download the project into your local computer. Alternatively you can clone the project by opening a Linux terminal (or Git BASH emulator for Windows) and run the below command:

git clone https://github.com/abalajoe/bankaccount

For UNIX based users, open the terminal, navigate to the run folder inside the project folder. Next, make the start script executable by executing the below command:

    sudo chmod +x startup.sh

Now you can run the program by executing the below command:

    sudo ./startup.sh

Alternatively (without using startup.sh), open the terminal, navigate to the run folder and execute the below commands:

    java -Dlog4j.configuration=file:"log4j.properties" -Dbankaccount.config="config.properties" -jar bankaccount.jar

For windows based users, navigate to the run folder, open the startup.bat file and edit the Java path to suit your computer's Java path. Next, open the command prompt, navigate to the run folder and execute the below command:

    startup.bat

NB: You must have Java installed on your computer and internet connection (Datasource is on cloud) to run the application.
